Our proposed solution- Smart Commute will be an all-in-one solution to change travel completely and making it suitable for the Modern Era.

Currently, there are many problems in the travel world which we have tried to analyse and address in our proposed idea. For instance, when an accident or emergency situation occurs, Emergency response takes a considerable amount of time which can be life threatening sometimes. To overcome this, we plan to develop a solution where our own phone camera can  help in detection of a crash or traffic warning and send an alert to nearby drivers and authorities with the location of the vehicle.

Our solution- Smart Commute will be an all-round solution and will take care of all travel related needs of passengers as well as drivers. Right from safety needs to entertainment, we’ve got you covered. We will have a feature to take a picture and by using Neural Networks, we’ll predict the facial expression and play personalised songs for the individual. 

We also plan to include voice based capabilities in our solution and a feature to find the shortest and safest route to a destination.
